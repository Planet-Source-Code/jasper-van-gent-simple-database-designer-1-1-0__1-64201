Simple Database Designer

=========================================================================================================================

Simple Database Designer is an easy to use application for creating database models. You can create tables,
fields and you can create relations between different table fields. Becouse Simple Database Designer is still
a beta release whe can't promise that the application will work without giving any kind of errors or even
fatal errors. We still are removing bugs and try to improve each beta release. The final release will not be
finished soon. First we would like to be sure that it works perfect.

Simple Database Designer was developed with Visual Basic 6. Because it's a OpenSource application everybody
can make it's one changes and improvements. You can download the SourceCode from Simple Database Designer
from the Planet Source Code (www.planetsourcecode.com) website (search for 'Simple Database Designer' into
the Visual Basic section).
